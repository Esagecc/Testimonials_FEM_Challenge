## My process
 
 I like to started with the mobile site because it requires less coding the beginning to adjust to the mobile site. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Font
- Software-VSC
- Google Browser
 - For styles



### What I learned
I was able to start immediatley with adding the html classes to seperate the cards. I used flexbox to line the pictures and the name and title.

I needed helped to learn how complete the grid flex. I watched Kevin Powell's video of the same challenge and understood how to do it. https://youtu.be/rg7Fvvl3taU



If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

A major delay of this project is that I was working in the wrong folder and accidentaly updated the download 'copy'. Which when I was pushing it in the Github, it was not updating the wrong file. I learned to delete the download copy and only have one copy in the computer. 


### Useful resources

Great resource for CSS is Kevin Powell in youtube and css.
